# Impossible-Rush-Game
A game to be played using the De1soc Armv7 processor

Base Game and Instructions:

Impossible Rush essentially requires the player to catch the incoming ball with the corresponding matching colour.
The game ends when the player fails to catch the correct colour and is indicated by the score resetting.
In order to rotate the square, press AND release any of the push buttons. Doing so will rotate the block to the right. 

Upgrade:

Unlike the original game, our game enables the possibility of balls not only coming at different speeds, but also from different sides. These sides are top, left and right. Furthermore, there are are chances of 2 special balls coming:

There is a ball with a question mark inside. This ball must be caught with the corresponding colour. Once caught, the order of the colours in the square will randomize, adding to the difficulty of the game

There is also a chance that after catching a ball,  a “x2” item will generate with an indicated colour. If the player is fast enough to pick up the item with the corresponding side of the square, the user will get a couple turns of x2 points with every successful turn. 

NOTE: it is not required to catch this item and will not end the game if not caught with the correct side of the square
Score for the game also appears on the hex as well as the on screen vga display
